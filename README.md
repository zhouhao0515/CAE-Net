# CAE-Net

This is the code for our CAE-Net from "Not the Statistical Bias, Mining the Essential Causality for Scene Graph Generation via Causal Association Extraction Network"

We have uploaded the core codes of our CF braches and MHD loss. 

The complete code and trained models will be re-organized and uploaded as soon as possible!
